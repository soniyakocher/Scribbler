# Scribbler website
The project is divided into three parts where each part represents a page in the website. All the pages have their independent project statements

Part A: Creating Home Page
The homepage will consist of 2 main segments:
a) The first part of the homepage consists of the header.The header consists of the title of your website as "ScriBBler", the subheading "Explore, Imagine, Create", a "Sign Up" button and a "Sign In" button.
b) The second part of the homepage consists of a segment which will consist of 2 buttons - "All Posts" and "Create Post".

1. Inside the header, you need to create:
a) The logo with the text "ScriBBler" towards the top-left corner of the screen Recall how you learnt to use fonts obtained from Google Fonts in your HTML CSS module. You must use the “Montez” font for writing this text.
for getting this font, go to Google Fonts, and select the "Montez" font by clicking on the red-colored plus button having tooltip as 'Select this font'.
b) A subheading with the text "Explore, Imagine, Create" just below the logo
c) A blue-colored "Sign In" button on the top-right side of the screen
d) A blue-colored "Sign Up" button on the top-right side of the screen
e)On clicking the "Sign Up" button, a modal should appear on the screen. A modal is basically a simple pop-up dialog box which can be used to display some information when a button is clicked. So instead of opening a separate sign-up page, you can open a modal which will be contained inside the existing screen.
f)On clicking the "Sign In" button, a modal should appear on screen. 

1. Creating two buttons in the centre of the page:
a) Create a yellow/orange colored button with the text "All Posts" in the centre (horizontally as well as vertically) of the page. The text inside this button should be in center.
b) Create another yellow/orange colored button with the text "Create Post" in the centre (horizontally as well as vertically) of the page. It should be placed towards the right side of  “All Posts” button. The text inside this button should be in center.
2. On clicking the "All Posts" button, the user should be taken to another page, which lists all the blog posts created. The code for this should be written inside a file named bloglist.html, which should be placed inside relevant folder. (For now, this can be an empty page, which you will create in the next part of your project.)

Part B: Creating PostsList Page
a) Each post is displayed in the form of a card,
When a user hovers on the post (displayed in the form of card), box shadow appears, as shown in the screenshot given below where the first post is hovered upon:
c) Each post will display the username of the user towards the left.
d) Towards the right of the username, you need to display the heading of the post. Below the heading of the post, you need to display the intial text of the post upto three lines only. Remember that you must not display the entire text of the post on this page itself. 
e) You need to add a "trash" icon towards the top-right of each post as shown in the screenshot given above. You can use the FontAwesome icon 'trash' for this purpose. 
f)You should display only two of posts in a row. This means that whatever screen size we reduce our screen to, there should be exactly two posts in each row (see screenshot given below). They should adjust their height/width automatically when the screen is resized
g)You need to add a small icon "..." next to each post. You can use the FontAwesome icon 'ellipsis-h' for this purpose. 



Part C: Creating Post Page
ou must incorporate the code for the header in this page, which you have already defined in Part A as well as Part B of the project. Place the header at the top of the "post.html" page.
b) You need to position the title of the post at the horizontal centre of the screen, just above the post text (the text contained in the post). You can use any font you want but you must place the post title and post text at the horizontal centre of the screen.
c) Just above the post text, you need to display the name of the author and position it towards the left of the screen. You can use any font you want but you must place the author name at the left of the screen, as shown in the screenshot given above.
d) You need to create an "Edit" button towards the top-right corner above the post text and in the same line as the post author, as shown in the screenshot given above. Remember to use the Font-Awesome icon named "edit" after the text in the button.
e) Below the post text, you need to create a "Like" button. The FontAwesome icon named "thumbs-up" should be prepended to the text "Like" in the button. When the page is loaded and the "Like" button is not clicked yet, a statement called "Be the first one to like this!" must be displayed 
f)Below the "Like" button, you must create an input box with the placeholder text "Leave a comment...". A user can type his/her comments in this box.
g) Below this box, you must create a red coloured "Comment" button, which when clicked, must display the typed comment inside the "All Comments" section.
